Rainbow

This game is a color delight.  Different colored tiles have
different values:

       Red	     0
       Orange	1
       Yellow	  2
       Green	  3
       Blue	     4
       Indigo	  5
       Violet	   6

Your also get 10 points for a tile if it is hit with the
same color ball except for the red tiles, they are always
worth nothing.

The ball starts out fast (700) and gets faster.  Fortunately,
you have 7 balls and 77 seconds to go after the 77 tiles.

Each time you miss the ball the ball changes color and
speeds up.
 
Good luck
