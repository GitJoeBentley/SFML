Rainbow

In this game, tiles have different values:
Red = 0
Orange = 1
Yellow = 2
Green = 3
Blue = 4
Indigo = 5
Violet = 6

Your also get 10 points for a tile if it is hit with the same color
ball except for the red tiles - they are always 0.

Each time you miss the ball with the paddle, the ball speeds up.
 
Good luck
