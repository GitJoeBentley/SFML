Falling Tiles

In this game, tiles will randomly start falling.  Falling tiles are
smaller than their original size and they fall at different rates.

If you hit a falling tile, it is worth 10 points, and causes the ball
to speed up a little bit.  If a falling tile gets passed the paddle, 
you lose 10 points.  If a falling tile hits the paddle, you automatically 
lose the game.  

Good luck
