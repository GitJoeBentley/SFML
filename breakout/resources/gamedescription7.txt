Two Balls 

In this game, you may be playing with two balls.  The game starts
with an "inactive" second ball in the inner rectangle surrounded
by tiles.  When you breakout the second ball, it becomes "active",
changes color and leaves the inner rectangle.

Tiles are worth one point each if you hit them with the first ball 
and two points it you hit them with the second ball.

The ball speed(s) are slow (500 and 250), but when both balls are
active it is hard to keep them both in play.  You have 10 balls and
100 seconds to go after 128 tiles.

Good luck
