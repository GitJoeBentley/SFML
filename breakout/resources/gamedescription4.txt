The Crusher

This game is impossible to win.  There are 150 tiles.
The ball is fast (600).  You have 10 balls, but that's
not enough.  Every time you miss the ball, the tiles
move down and the ball will speeds up a little. You'll
need lightning fast reactions and ball control to even
stand a chance.
 
Good luck
