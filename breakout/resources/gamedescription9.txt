150 Tiles

In this game, there is a possible 150 tiles in random locations.
The game starts with only 120 tiles visible.  There are 5 different
colors and 5 different sizes for the tiles.  Each color has
a different point value:

Blue = 1     (the largest tile)
Green = 2
Yellow = 3
Orange = 4
Red = 5      (the smallest tile)

When you hit a red tile, a new one with be generated in a different 
location.  This happens until you've hit 30 red tiles.

The ball starts fairly slow (500), but increase by 3% whenever you
hit a red tile.  You've got 10 balls and 100 seconds to go after
120 tiles.


Good luck
