Joe's Breakout Game

This game was inspired by the Atari Breakout game (1976) and the open source LBreakout2 game.
This game, instead of a series of levels, consists of 10 variations of breakout with different
behaviors given to the game balls, the paddle, and events such as hitting a tile, hitting the
ball with the paddle of missing the ball.

The goal in all variations of the game is to hit as many tiles as possible with the available
balls and within the allotted time. To win any of the games, except "One Red Tile", you must 
remove (hit) all of the tiles.  This makes it very difficult to win most of the games.  You have
the opportunity to achieve a high score and make the top-10 leaderboard for each game.  Each
game awards points in a various ways.

To play the game, you may use right and left arrow keys on the keyboard, a game controller using
the joystick, or a mouse to move the paddle left and right.  Each game has a different number of
tiles, a  different number of balls available, and different time allotments.

To get started, choose any one of the 10 games on the main screen by clicking with the left-mouse
button.  You can also get a game description using the right-mouse button.

Best of luck
