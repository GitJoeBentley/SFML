The goal of this game is to traverse a hidden maze using the four arrow keys.  You will start
in the upper left corner and proceed to the lower right corner.  Along the way you will collide 
with five types of walls.  Each wall, except the rubber wall, will give you a bruise.

Types of Walls

Solid   (Black)       walls cannot be penetrated unless you use a bomb
Hard    (Dark gray)   will break if you hit them 3 times
Medium  (Medium gray) will break if you hit them 2 times
Soft    (Light gray)  will break if you hit them once
Rubber  (Magenta)     no bruise, but you will be bounced to a random location

You will lose the game if you take more than 60 seconds to traverse the maze or if you receive
50 bruises.  Points are awarded as you progress through the maze.

The maze is flashed for one second at the beginning of the game.  You can also request another
flash using the F key.
